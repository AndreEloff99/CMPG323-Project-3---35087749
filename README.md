# CMPG323-Project-3---35087749

The project started on about a week and a half back or so. I dropped the given code in the repo on main and created a develop branch short after. I created a Repo brach and started adding the Repository folder and its contents in the Repo branch. Then I pushed all to the develop brach and then when it was completely error free then I pushed to the main brach to ensure the main branch is not compromised with a stack of overwelliming errors. Develop brach was used to sort errors and to have a look if the code will fit in the main branch. The repo branch was used to to input the ruff code in the unshaped form.

The .gitignore file was used so that critical information was not leaked out in the repository, information like the appsettings.
