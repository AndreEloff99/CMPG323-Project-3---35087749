# CMPG323-Project-3---35087749

The project started on about a week and a half back or so. I dropped the given code in the repo on main and created a develop branch short after. I created a Repo brach and started adding the Repository folder and its contents in the Repo branch. Then I pushed all to the develop brach and then when it was completely error free then I pushed to the main brach to ensure the main branch is not compromised with a stack of overwelliming errors. Develop brach was used to sort errors and to have a look if the code will fit in the main branch. The repo branch was used to to input the ruff code in the unshaped form.
